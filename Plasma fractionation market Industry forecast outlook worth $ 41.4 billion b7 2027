Meticulous Research®– leading global market research company, published a research report titled “Plasma Fractionation Market  by Product [Immunoglobulins (Intravenous, Subcutaneous), Coagulation Factors, Albumin], Application (Immunology, Haematology, Neurology), and End User (Hospital, Clinical Research Lab, Academic Institutes) - Forecast to 2027
The plasma fractionation market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7% from 2020 to 2027 to reach $41.4 billion by 2027. Plasma-derived products from plasma fractionation have therapeutic effects, which are employed for the treatment of various disorders. For instance, coagulation factor VIII, which is a plasma derivative, is used for the treatment and prophylaxis of hemophilia. Furthermore, it is also employed to stop excessive blood loss during surgical procedures. Similarly, immunoglobulins are employed in the treatment of primary and secondary immune deficiencies. Factors such as the rising use of immunoglobulins in therapeutic areas, increasing number of chronic diseases, and growing number of plasma collection centers are the drivers of the market.
